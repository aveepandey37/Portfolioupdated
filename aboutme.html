<p> Hello! I'm Avinash Pandey, a passionate and dedicated B.Tech Computer Science student with a curiosity for all types of Computer technologies. Currently pursuing my degree at Chandigarh Group of Colleges, Landran, I've embarked on a journey to explore the ever-evolving world of computer science.

    My fascination with technology began at a young age, and it's grown into a deep-seated passion. From coding to creating, I've found my home in the realm of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving. As a believer in the power of innovation, I'm always seeking new ways to leverage technology to make a positive impact on the world around us.</p>
